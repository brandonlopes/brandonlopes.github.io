## Hello and Welcome!

This site is made using a Static Site Generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted here using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The source code on this site is under the [MIT License](https://github.com/brandonlopes/library_app/blob/master/LICENSE), so feel free to go through it, download it, and use this as a template and make any modifications to it that you like.

### HTML and Markdown
The HTML (or content) on this site is made almost entirely using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown files are simple text files that can be styled using symbols to represent different formating.

For example, to make some text **bold** you would use 2 asterisks on both sides of the word or phrase. `**like this**`

Writing content in markdown is much more intuitive than writing it in HTML. I don't have to worry about styling or tags and can focus on the content itself. I can even write on my phone since these are just regular text files.

Jekyll allows you to turn markdown files into HTML. Speeding up the process of writing and publishing quite a bit

### CSS
I wanted to make the styling of this site as simple and as painless as possible. I've kept all the styling in 1 css file, no sass or special processors, just plain css.

### Javascript
Like the rest of the site, I wanted it to be simple and managable. No large costly frameworks here, just good ol' [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/)
