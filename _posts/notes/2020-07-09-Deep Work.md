- Focusing deeply on a single task without interuptions is the definition of deep work and the method for producing quality work becoming the best at a certain task/in a certain field etc. This is able to be done anywhere, and I can turn my room and home into a haven for this work

- Be intentional with leisure time. Fill the remaining 16 hours of your day with moving, and you'll end it feeling accomplished, motivated, and happy. The next work day will be improved by your meaningful leisure, or "the day within a day" and will show you the difference between living, and simply existing

### Deep Work Limits
- 4 hours a day on true, uninterrupted depth, according to a paper on deliberate practice
- 1 hour a day on a new skill

### Scheduling Your Day
- Pause during the day and ask yourself "what makes the most sense right now?"
- When making a schedule, minimum size is of block should be 30 minutes
- If interrupted, recreate schedule and/or remove things. Goal is not to be rigid, but to be thoughtful about your day
- Deep work requires you to respect your time. Scheduling your day will make sure you can do everything that matters to you and how shallow some activities are
- A schedule should be treated as a guideline for your day. Some structure is better than no structure at all
