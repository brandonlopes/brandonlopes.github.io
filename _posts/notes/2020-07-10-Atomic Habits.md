## Summary
- Small and consistent changes/actions are the best way to build habits and lead to big results
- Forget about goals, focus on systems instead
  - Goals are for setting direction, systems are for making progress
  - Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment, systems change your life continuously. Focus on your inputs instead of your output.
- Fall in love with the process, and you will always be happy
- 4 Laws of Habit Building - Explained with brushing your teeth
  - Make it **Obvious** - The sensation of morning breath makes it pretty obvious that your teeth need to be brushed
  - Make it **Attractive** - You don't want bad breath or yellow teeth, so brushing your teeth is pretty attractive
  - Make it **Easy** - All you need is water, tooth paste, and some scrubbin
  - Make it **Satisfying** - That fresh feeling in your mouth and minty smell is what cements the habit and makes you continue to do it. If tooth paste didn't smell good or make your mouth feel clean, you would never brush your teeth with it, if it all.

- Habits are learned solutions to problems
  - Your Netflix/Gaming habit is the learned solution to your problem of stress or boredom, find a new one
- Just get your reps in. Repetition is how patterns are formed
- Active practice > passive learning
- Best way to practice is to make it easy and eventually automatic
- Make good habits easy to do, and bad habits hard/impossible to do through environment design.
  - An example would be to take the batteries out of the remote after using your TV. That extra bit of effort might stop a future Netflix binge.
- **2 Minute Rule**
  - Make "showing up" the first habit and start by **only** doing 2 minutes of the activity and stop completely after those 2 minutes.
  - Chances are, you'll want to continue to do the thing after the 2 minutes are up. If not, that's okay because 2 minutes of something is better than not doing it at all.
  - 1 push up is infinitely better than 0. A shitty program or story or drawing is infinitely better than nothing at all.

- 1 habit for 1 location
- If space is limited, use specific spaces for specific habits. Examples:
  - Bed is only for sleeping
  - Second desk for writing

- "Work hard on the things that come easy. Doing the thing when it's boring or painful is the difference between success and failure, between a professional and an amateur." Do the thing every day. Through the ups and downs. Consistency is key
  - Find your niche and exploit it. The things that you're probably better at than the average person. Combine them to make that funny comic combo of being funnier than the average person, plus being a decent artist
  - You're a decent writer and coder, do something with them

- There's going to be a lot of workouts, coding, and reading that you won't want to do, but you have never regretted doing them. Don't let life get in the way of your goals and habits. Do them and show up every day

- Keep your identity small, clinging too tightly to one aspect of your personality/identity will only result in disaster.
  - Instead of being a vegan, you are someone that cares about the things you do and the food you eat and the impact it has on yourself and others
  - Tao Te Ching reference: Be soft and yielding, easy and adaptable, like water
  - Lack of self awareness is poison, reflection and review are the antidote
