I"İ<p>This is a collection of quotes and sayings I find valuable</p>

<p>â€œWe all have two lives. The second begins when we realize we only have one.â€ -Confucius</p>

<p>â€œThis too shall passâ€ -Unknown</p>

<p>â€œWe suffer more often in imagination than we do in realityâ€ -Seneca</p>

<p>â€œI have 3 treasures that I keep and prize: one is kindness, second is frugality, and third is not presuming to take precedence over others. By kindness one can be brave, by frugality one can reach out, by not presuming to take precedence one can survive effectivelyâ€ - Master Sun Tzu</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Donâ€™t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, â€œWhy is this so unbearable? Why canâ€™t I endure it?â€ Youâ€™ll be embarrassed to answer.â€ - Marcus Aurelius</p>

<p>â€œTo feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that theyâ€™re human too, that they act out of ignorance against their will, and that youâ€™ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they havenâ€™t really hurt you.â€ - Marcus Aurelius</p>

<p>â€œLearn to enjoy the process. Love the daily discipline of showing up everyday and having the thing itself generate its own satisfactionâ€ - James Clear</p>

<p>â€œPerfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take awayâ€ - Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p>

<p>â€œClarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at onceâ€ - Michael Hoffman</p>

<p>â€œSimply focus on being better today than you were yesterday, and youâ€™ll be happy with your achievementsâ€ - Marie Kondo</p>

<p>â€œLess is more. Itâ€™s also less. Thatâ€™s the point.â€ - Greg McKeown</p>

<p>â€œRenounce the fruit of action, rejoice in action itself.â€ - Unknown</p>

<p>â€œAll of humanityâ€™s problems stem from manâ€™s inability to sit quietly in a room aloneâ€ - Blaise Pascal</p>

<p>â€œHappiness is the absence of unhappiness. This reminds me that I donâ€™t have to search for happiness. I just have to eliminate the things that make me unhappy.â€ - Unknown</p>

<p>â€œHappiness is your default state. I can relax. Happiness is already mine.â€</p>

<h2 id="on-the-shortness-of-life-by-seneca">On the Shortness of Life by Seneca</h2>

<p>â€œLet us prepare our minds as if weâ€™d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance lifeâ€™s books each dayâ€¦The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.â€ - Seneca</p>

<p>â€œPutting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow, and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortuneâ€™s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.â€ - Seneca</p>

<h2 id="thomas-jeffersons-summary-of-epicurean-ethics">Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s summary of Epicurean ethics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Happiness is the aim of life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emotional health is the foundation of happiness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When emotional health is present, everything comes together as it should.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pleasure is found in activities which satisfy our healthy, legitimate needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuing satisfaction of these healthy needs brings lasting contentment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pleasurable activity is not itself happiness, but the means to produce it - for example, the relief of hunger brings satisfaction, and eating is the means to achieve it. It follows that these activities have a natural limit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our goal is to be not pained in body, nor troubled in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unhealthy needs, and fear, are the main causes of distress. We are free to turn ourselves away from them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A healthy person is thoughtful, not impulsive or grasping, and is unafraid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A troubled person is reckless, and driven by unhealthy needs and fear.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
