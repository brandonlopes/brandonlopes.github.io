<p>I am not a religious person, but if I had a bible, this would be it. This is the book that ignited a love of philosophy, reading, and being the best man I can be for myself and the people around me.</p>

<p>I love this book. It is astounding and I have read and listened to it dozens of times.</p>

<p>James Clear drives home the point that small, consistent efforts and enjoying the process are what allow you to reach your goals and do great things. If youâ€™re interested at all in how habits work and how to build/break them, give this book a go.</p>

<p>Atomic Habits is the reason I started going to the library every day to work on this website, and I couldnâ€™t be more grateful.</p>
