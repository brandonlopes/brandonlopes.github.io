<!-- ### The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
![Meditations](/assets/images/meditations.jpg)

I am not a religious person, but if I had a bible, this would be it. This is the book that ignited a love of philosophy, reading, and being the best man I can be for myself and the people around me.

The nearly two-thousand year-old private journal of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Meditations contains practical wisdom and stoic teachings that stand the test of time and continues to be a relevant member of home libraries to this day.

If you haven't read this book yet, I implore you to. You won't regret it.

### Atomic Habits

I love this book. It is astounding and I have read and listened to it dozens of times.

James Clear drives home the point that small, consistent efforts and enjoying the process are what allow you to reach your goals and do great things. If you're interested at all in how habits work and how to build/break them, give this book a go.

Atomic Habits is the reason I started going to the library every day to work on this website, and I couldn't be more grateful. -->
