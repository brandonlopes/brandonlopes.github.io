    <p>Focusing deeply on a single task without interuptions is the definition of deep work and the method for producing quality work becoming the best at a certain task/in a certain field etc. This is able to be done anywhere, and I can turn my room and home into a haven for this work</p>

    <p>Be intentional with leisure time. Fill the remaining 16 hours of your day with moving, and you’ll end it feeling accomplished, motivated, and happy. The next work day will be improved by your meaningful leisure, or “the day within a day” and will show you the difference between living, and simply existing</p>
